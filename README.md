# Launch WebTerminals from InterSystems Server Manager

This extension adds a command button to each entry in the [InterSystems Server Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=intersystems-community.servermanager) tree. With this button you can launch a [WebTerminal](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/package/WebTerminal) onto the chosen server.

The button is also available in the Namespaces tree of each server. Use it there to start your WebTerminal in a specific namespace. This action also adds the namespace name to the label of the WebTerminal tab.

The launch button creates a WebTerminal in a tab in VS Code. If you prefer to open WebTerminal in your default web browser, use the context menu of the server row or namespace row.

## Requirements

This extension requires the InterSystems Server Manager extension to be installed, and will install it automatically if it is not.

WebTerminal must already be installed on the target servers.
